  text: "<p>The Outer Space Act 1986 (the Act) is the legal basis for the regulation of activities in outer space carried out by organisations or individuals established in the United Kingdom or one of its Overseas Territories (OTs) or Crown Dependencies (CDs).</p><p>The Act confers licensing and other powers on the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who carries these powers out through the UK Space Agency. The Act seeks to ensure compliance with the UK’s obligations under international treaties and principles covering the use of outer space, including liability for damage caused by space objects, the registration of objects launched into outer space and the principles for the remote sensing of the Earth.</p><p>Download a copy of the Outer Space Act 1986, plus the amendments made to the Act by section 12 of the Deregulation Act 2015. Applicants are strongly advised to make themselves familiar with its provisions, before completing the application form.</p>"

N.B. This exception does not apply to persons involved in telemetry, tracking and control of satellites in orbit.</li></ul><h3 class='heading-medium'>Notes:</h3><ul class='list-bullet'><li>Applicants should consult UK Space Agency (contact details may be found at the end of these notes) if they are in any doubt as to whether they need a licence. The Agency encourages applicants to contact them as early as possible to discuss the best way forward for their mission.</li><li>Applications should be submitted at least six months in advance of any plans for launch or operation. In certain circumstances it may be possible to process an application in a reduced timescale (in some cases in as little as three months), although we are unable to guarantee this. Please contact us in plenty of time to discuss if a reduced timescale would be possible and the steps you would have to take.</li><li>Applicants from one of the UK’s Overseas Territories to which the Act has been extended (Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Bermuda) will need to apply to their own Governor’s office for an OSA licence.</li><li>Applicants from one of the UK’s Overseas Territories to which the Act has not been extended should approach the Government of the Overseas Territory, which would then liaise with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and UK Space Agency over whether it was appropriate to extend the Act to that territory. If decided upon, extension of the Act would be by Order in Council. This is a lengthy process and could take many months.</li></ul>"

  text: "<p>It is an offence for a person to whom the Act applies to carry on a licensable activity without a valid licence.</p><p>Under section 10 of the Act, all persons to whom the Act applies must indemnify the UK Government against any claims for damage or loss arising out of licensable activities.</p><p>Licences for space activity granted onwards of 1 October 2015 under the Outer Space Act include a cap on the liability imposed on licensees (see Annex B for full details). Please note, currently the liability cap does not apply in the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories to which the Outer Space Act has been extended.</p><p>In addition, the Secretary of State has discretion to attach conditions to the grant of a licence. Download a copy of a typical licence, which includes our standard conditions.</p><p>UK Space Agency standard insurance requirement (at clause 6 of the attached sample licence) is that licensees must insure themselves against third party liabilities arising from each licensed activity (i.e. the launch and in-orbit phases of the mission). For each licence application, a risk assessment will be performed to consider the potential risks posed by the mission and a commensurate level of insurance cover will be determined. In the majority of cases, involving single satellite missions employing established launchers, satellite platforms and operational profiles, this insurance cover would be limited to €60 Million. The UK Government must be named as an additional insured party and in the case of applications from companies in the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, the relevant territorial Government should also be named.</p><p>Additional conditions may be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each application.</p>"

  text: "<p>The information provided with the initial application is assessed and UK Space Agency may need to seek further information or clarification of particular points from the applicant in the course of assessing the application. UK Space Agency will normally seek a meeting with the applicants at an early opportunity to help us to understand the activity to be licensed. In particular, we will wish to ascertain whether there are any novel or special circumstances that might have a bearing on the licence. At all stages of the licensing process, UK Space Agency will keep the applicants informed and explain the reasons for any decisions or additional requests for information.</p><p>Normally, the main stages of the licensing process are:</p><ul class='list-bullet'><li>identification of whether a licence is required and initial contact /consultation: to explain the licensing process to the applicant and for UK Space Agency to learn whether there are any special circumstances related to the mission (Stage 0);</li><li>completed application form and initial information, together with fee received by UK Space Agency (Stage 1);</li><li>suitability of applicant’s insurance cover: to ensure that the cover for the mission provides appropriate cover for the UK Government under the conditions of the licence (Stage 2);</li><li>applicant’s financial status: to ensure that the applicants have adequate resources to carry out the proposed activity and to meet and maintain their obligations under the licence (e.g. continuing to meet insurance premium payments) and that the applicant is sufficiently sound to enable a licence to be issued (bearing in mind (i) the UK Government’s potential liabilities for the activity under international treaties, and (ii) the statutory indemnity in favour of the Government from everyone to whom the OSA applies and which is contained in the OSA) (Stage 2);</li><li>technical assessment: to ensure that the launch and operation of the space object conform with international treaties (e.g. the requirements on liability and registration) and law and that they do not pose a risk to lives or property (Stage 2);</li><li>checks with OFCOM to ensure that correct ITU filings have been made (i.e. that the frequencies used will not cause interference issues) (Stage 2);</li><li>licence application review - political and legal: UK Space Agency liaise as appropriate with other Government Departments and partners (e.g. MoD, PPARC, NERC) to ensure that the licensed activity does not affect Government activities (Stage 2);</li><li>final decision: UK Space Agency ensures that all checks are complete and decides whether or not to issue the licence.

  text: "<p>Before a licence can be granted UK Space Agency must be satisfied that the proposed activities will not jeopardise public health, the safety of persons or property, or national security. UK Space Agency will also wish to be satisfied that the proposed activities will not compromise the UK’s ability to carry out its obligations under the various international treaties and agreements that govern space activities.</p><p>During the licensing process set out above, UK Space Agency and its advisors will assess any information submitted.
