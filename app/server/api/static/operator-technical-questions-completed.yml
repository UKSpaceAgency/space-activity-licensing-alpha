    text: Q1. Are there plans for disposal at the end of the space object’s life (e.g. re-orbit, de orbit, retrieval) and if so, what effect will this have on airspace?

    value: "The ABC-1  will undergo a controlled de-orbit manoeuvre and be passivated. Atmospheric drag will then cause ABC-1 to re-enter and create small amounts of debris, simulations predict up to 288 pieces of debris. Simulations predict the size of debris to range between 100g and 5 kg mass and 10cm3 to 500cm3 volume reaching the surface.\nThe predicted date time for re-entry is between 12:00UTC and 15:00UTC on 1st April 2000. A hazard area for the debris returning to the surface is predicted within the North Atlantic region.\nThe dangerous zone ZD, which concerns the European airspace, corresponds to the falling area of the third stage elements of ABC-1 (Cap-Z). The impacted FIR are EGGX Shanwick Oceanic and LPPO Santa Maria Oceanic.\nThe ZD zone is delimited as follows: 4822N01107W 4752N01037W 4507N01606W 4535N01638W"

    value: An ion thruster or ion drive is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating positive ions with electricity. The term refers strictly to gridded electrostatic ion thrusters, and is often incorrectly loosely applied to all electric propulsion systems including electromagnetic plasma thrusters. An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions.

    value: Nuclear propulsion includes a wide variety of propulsion methods that fulfill the promise of the Atomic Age by using some form of nuclear reaction as their primary power source. The idea of using nuclear material for propulsion dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 it was hypothesised that radioactive material, radium, might be a suitable fuel for engines to propel cars, boats, and planes.[1] H. G. Wells picked up this idea in his 1914 fiction work The World Set Free.

    value: Every NASA mission has a communications system to receive commands and other information sent from Earth to the spacecraft, and to return scientific data from the spacecraft to Earth. The vast majority of deep space missions never return to Earth. Thus, after launch, a spacecraft’s tracking and communications systems is the only means with which to interact with it.
